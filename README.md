# Avocado
Data Analysis Project using Python on Avocado dataset

In this project, I will use the "Avocado Prices" dataset from Kaggle, which can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices.
The goal of this project is to analyze the trends and patterns in avocado prices in different regions of the United States over time. Specifically, we will explore the following research questions:
1- How have avocado prices changed over time?
2- How do avocado prices vary by region?
3- Is there a relationship between avocado prices and the number of avocados sold?
4- Are there seasonal patterns in avocado prices?
5- How do organic and conventional avocado prices compare?
6- How do avocado prices vary by region and type?

After finishing our analysis as showed in the python file and HTML file also, We can get the insights as following:


- Avocado prices have generally increased over time, with some fluctuations.
- Avocado prices are generally higher in the Northeast and West regions, and lower in the Southeast and Midwest regions.
- There is a weak negative correlation between avocado prices and the total volume of avocados sold.
- There are seasonal patterns in avocado prices, with higher prices during the first half of the year.
- Organic avocados are generally more expensive than conventional avocados, and there are some regional differences in avocado prices.
